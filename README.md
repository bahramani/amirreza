# Hi, I'm Amirreza Bahramani

âš¡ I'm a first-year M.Sc. student at Sharif University, where I'm studying Electrical Engineering.

ðŸ¦œ I'm also a neuroscience researcher at the Birds' Lab in the School of Cognitive Sciences at IPM. I'm currently researching the fascinating world of Zebra Finches and their vocal learning, with a focus on the neural mechanisms behind it.

ðŸ§  I love to know more about minds & brains through Neuroscience and Philosophy.

ðŸ“– By the way, I'm a book nerd :)
